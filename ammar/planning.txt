Oksothe plan is to implement fp growth serially, then with parallel optimizations.
If I find fp to be too difficult, then I will do eclat !


Let's briefly recap about fp growth a little bit. 

step 1: Build a compact data structure called an fp-tree.
 -> need 2 passes over the data.

step 2:extract frequent items directly from the fp tree
